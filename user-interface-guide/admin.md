## Users and User Profile

The list of users are all users who have rights to perform certain actions \(as defined by [Roles](admin.md#roles)\) to certain parts of content \(as defined by [Teams](admin.md#teams)\). Here is how to create a new user, and to view your user profile.

**Email address, Name, Display name and Password**: Apply the user's email address, name and password. Display name is the name that will be displayed in the upper right corner of the user interface.

Please note that Adnuntius does not automatically send an email inviting the user to the network. So make sure that you inform the user about his/her new user and password.
