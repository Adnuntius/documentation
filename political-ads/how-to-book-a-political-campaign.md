# How to Book a Political Campaign

There are four steps to creating a political campaign:&#x20;

1. Create an Advertiser (if you haven't created it before).&#x20;
2. Create an Order (if you haven't created it before).
3. Create a line item.
4. Create one or more creatives.&#x20;

## Buyers Guide

## Before we Begin: Purpose

The Transparency and targeting of political advertising regulation (TTPA) is essentially about providing information to consumers, so the unique steps to political ads booking is about ensuring that this information is presented to users. This information is presented to users on two main objects:&#x20;

1. The **label** hovering over the creative when it is shown to the user. This label will contain the name of the Advertiser (considered a sponsor), information about the election or political event, and a link to more information.&#x20;
2. The **transparency notice** (information page) that displays if the user clicks on the label. This page contains information about the Advertiser (sponsor), controlling entity, paying entity, campaign, election or event, and targeting.

The following guide shows you how to add this information.&#x20;

## 1 Create an Advertiser

Go to [https://admin.adnuntius.com/advertisers](https://admin.adnuntius.com/advertisers) and click "New" in the upper right corner, then fill in the information as you would with a normal Advertiser ([as instructed here](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/advertising/advertisers.md)). To enable an Advertiser to run political ads, check the checkbox "Enable Political Advertising for this Advertiser".&#x20;

Below is an overview of the fields that are mandatory for political advertising (mandatory fields in blue).

If you haven't filled in all required information you will see a blue warning label at the top of the Advertiser page.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also send a form to the advertiser, asking them to provide the information for you - [learn more about the "invite editor" function.](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/advertising/advertisers.md#invite-editor)
{% endhint %}

### 1.1 More about Budgets

You will need to provide budgets for the election or political event intended for advertising, and budgets on each topic or campaign.&#x20;

* The **election budget** should be the total budget (not including VAT), including all benefits received for the entire election or political event - including all costs, such as production costs - across all channels.
* The **campaign/topic-level budget** should be the total budget (not including VAT), including all benefits received for this particular topic or message - including all costs, such as production costs - across all channels.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you cannot find the election or political event you look for in the Advertiser dropdown list, tell us what you need on support@adnuntius.com. We fetch a list of elections from a public service, but we are also able to quickly add more on request.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### 1.2 More about Sponsor, Controlling and Paying Entities

The Advertiser should be considered "the sponsor" according to the TTPA. Sometimes you may have an advertiser who is controlled by another entity, and/or an advertiser whose campaign is paid for by another entity. If so you are required to provide this information to the public.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that if you make changes, it may take up to 10 minutes before the changes are displayed in the transparency notice.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## 2 Create an Order

There are no mandatory fields on the Order; just create one as usual as [described here](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/advertising/orders.md).&#x20;

## 3 Create a Line Item

When creating a line item, follow the process [described here](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/advertising/line-items.md). The additional information required for political ad line items is (1) Election budget, and (2) Campaign budget. These will be fetched from the parent Advertiser, so if you have specified one or more election budgets and campaign budgets on the Advertiser, this is what you will see in the dropdown menu on the line item as shown below. &#x20;

{% endhint %}

## 4 Create One or more Creatives

Lastly, create a creative by following the steps [described here](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/advertising/creatives.md). Creative layouts are limited to image and video assets to ensure compliance. See asset specs for political ads [here](ad-specification-for-political-ads.md).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The creative preview will render a text box overlay with example values. The text box will be populated correctly when rendered in live enviroment.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Other details

If a user chooses to report an ad, they can do so from the information page (see the button in the bottom right). All reports are first sent to Adnuntius for review. We reserve the right to pause or stop a campaign if we detect any issues or policy violations. The advertiser will be notified in such cases, and the publisher will also be informed about the decision.
