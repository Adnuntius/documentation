# Ad specification for political ads

We offer two ways to do political ads in our system to make sure that no cookies are set on the client.

* Image ads
* Video ads

These also come as high impact ads, but we still need to host the material in our ad server.

### Image ads

Format: GIF, JPG, PNG, SVG

Max file size: 550kb

### Video ads

Format: MP4, WebM, mov

Max file size: 50 Mb



### Safe Zones

For all political ads, make sure to leave room at the bottom of your ad to for the overlay that a user can click.&#x20;

**For ads with a maximum width of 320px:** Allow for at least 60px of space at the bottom.&#x20;

**For ads between 320px and 512px:**  Allow for 48px of space at the bottom&#x20;

**For ads wider than 512px:** Allow for 36px of space at the bottom&#x20;

Note: these recommendations cover the vast majority of cases. If either the advertiser name or election name is particularly long, the text box height may increase accordingly.
