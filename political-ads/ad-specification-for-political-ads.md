# Ad specification for political ads

We offer two ways to do political ads in our system to make sure that no cookies are set on the client.

* Image ads
* Video ads

These also come as high impact ads, but we still need to host the material in our ad server.

### Image ads

Format: GIF, JPG, PNG, SVG

Max file size: 550kb

### Video ads

Format: MP4, WebM, mov

Max file size: 50 Mb



### Other information

For all political ads, make sure to leave at least 24 pixel up top of your ad to leave room for the overlay that a user can click.
