# Adn. Advertising for Publishers

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS AND WILL SOON BE COMPLETED.

You will find full documentation of the underlying platform \(Adnuntius Advertising\) [here](adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/). The purpose of this guide however, is to make implementation easier for our new customers. The steps below contains the basic steps. There are more advanced functions that you can read up on under the full documentation, but these steps should make you familiar with the platform's basic features. 

This guide assumes that you have been given access to Adnuntius Advertising. However, if you haven't please contact us at [support@adnuntius.com](mailto:support@adnuntius.com).

| What and Why | Create | How |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 Create an earnings account. Earnings accounts let you aggregate earnings that one or more sites have made. Here is how you create an earnings account. | [Start creating](https://admin.adnuntius.com/earnings-accounts) | [Documentation](adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/inventory/earnings-accounts.md) |
| 2 Create a site group. If you only have one site you can skip this. If you have more than one, you can start by creating one site group called "All sites".  | Start creating | Documentation |
| 3 Create a site. A site is a domain where you would like ads to go. Start by creating one site so that you learn the process, and then you can create more later. | Start creating | Documentation |
| 4 Create or rename your team. You already have a team created, but you can now rename it to your liking, and/or create more teams. | Start creating | Documentation |
| 5 Create an ad unit. Start by creating one site so that you learn the process, and then you can create more later. Start by creating one ad unit, then you can create more later.  | Start creating | Documentation |
| 6 Create an advertiser. An advertiser is a client that wants to advertise on your sites. If you have no advertisers yet, try creating your own company as an advertiser \(which may be useful for house ads anyway\). | Start creating | Documentation |
| 7 Create an order. An advertiser can contain one or more orders. An order is also a folder for line items, and also determines which team that the campaign should belong to. | Start creating | Documentation |
| 8 Create a line item \(with targeting and creatives\). A line item determines start and end dates, delivery objectives and more. Try targeting the creative to the ad unit you created in step 5, and remember to use a size that is supported by that ad unit.  | Start creating | Documentation |
| 9 Try to generate an ad impression using a service like [Tryit](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_basic). Copy and paste your ad tag from your ad unit into the body, and then click "run". Is your ad showing?  |  |  |

These first steps should show you the basics of getting up and running. You can now create more sites, ad units and line items, so that you will soon have set up your account for implementation \([documented here](adnuntius-advertising/requesting-ads/)\).
