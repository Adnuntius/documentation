# Requesting an Ad

`adn.request` is the most basic way to get an ad on your page. Here's a typical example:

```text
    adn.request({ auId: '000000000000042d', auW: 364, auH: 90 });
```

This will do the following:

* ask the Adnuntius ad server for an ad from the ad unit with id `000000000000042d`
* set aside a 364Ã—90 pixels space on the web page even before an ad is received from the Adnuntius ad server
* put the ad content from the Adnuntius ad server into an HTML element with an ID of `adn-000000000000042d`

### **The adn.request Parameter Object**

The table below outlines how to tailor the basic adn.request call.

<table>  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter and Basic Description</th>
    <th>Things of note</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><code>auId</code></p>
      <p>The ad unit id</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      No ad request is made to the Adnuntius ad server without an auId specified.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><code>auW</code> and <code>auH</code></p>
      <p>Ad unit's initial width and height before it receives an ad server response.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      Can be anything that works as a CSS value. <code>10</code>, <code>'10px'</code>, <code>'10%'</code>,
      <code>'10vh'</code> etc. are all valid. Can be set to 0 or
      unspecified if not wanting to reserve space for an ad in the page before one is received from the ad server.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><code>env</code></p>
      <p>Specifies which environment's ad server to use.</p>

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><code>protocol</code></p>
      <p>Specifies whether to use <code>http</code> or <code>https</code> in the ad server request.</p>

    <td>
      Defaults to the protocol the web page is using.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><code>targetId</code></p>
      <p>Specifies which element ID in the page to insert an ad into.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      Defaults to <code>adn-{value-of-auId}</code>. Comes most in handy when multiple requests to the
      same ad unit are made to the ad server from the same page. If the same target ID is used multiple times on the same page,
      will cycle through the HTML elements that match the ID until an empty one is found in which to put the ad. However, to ensure the requested ad
      is
      put into the expected spot on the page, unique IDs must be used in your page.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><code>targetClass</code></p>
      <p>Specifies the class by which to find an element to insert an ad into.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>If more than one HTML element matches the CSS class specified, will cycle through the HTML elements until it finds an empty one in which to
        put the ad. If no empty
        HTML element is found, will fill the first HTML element found and put the ad there.</p>
      If <code>targetClass</code> is not specified, will use <code>adn-{value-of-auId}</code> or the value specified in <code>targetId</code> to find
      the ID of the element in which to place the ad content.

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><code>ps</code></p>
      <p>Defines the maximum number of ads that the ad server returns to fill the ad unit, known as the page size.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      An integer is expected. If unspecified, will use the page size that the ad unit in Adnuntius specifies. If
      no page size is specified even there, there is no limit to the number of ads that can be returned to fill
      out the ad unit.

    </td>
    <td>
      Defaults to <code>true</code>. By default, the ad unit will resize itself to match the size of the
      ad unit content as soon as an ad is received AND resize itself again to match the size of the ad unit
      content once all its content has finished loading. This parameter decides whether the ad unit will resize

</table>## **Multi adn.request Calls**

Multi `adn.request` calls allow for the Adnuntius ad server to be asked for multiple ad units' worth of ads in one request. This makes deduplication much more effective, meaning for instance, that the same line item or creative doesn't appear on the same web page multiple times in different locations.

Here's a typical example of a multi ad request:

```text
    adn.request({ adUnits: [
        {auId: '0000000000000806', auW: 728, auH: 90},
        {auId: '0000000000000807', auW: 100, auH: 20},
        {auId: '0000000000000808', auW: 40, auH: 40}
    ]});
```

This will do the following:

* ask the Adnuntius ad server for ads to fulfil the three ad units in the `adUnits` array
* set aside space on the web page for each of the ad units even before an ad is received from the Adnuntius ad server
* put the ad content from the Adnuntius ad server into the appropriate HTML elements for each of the ad units

### **requestParams on Multi adn.request Calls**

Multi ad requests also allow for two special modes of loading ads onto your page:

* **Lazy Request:** A request for your ad unit will be made only after the user's viewport is within a particular range of the ad unit
* **Lazy Load:** One request will be made for all your ad units, but the ad itself will only be loaded into the page content after the user's viewport is within a particular range of the ad unit

These modes of loading ads can be specified via the `requestParams` parameter. A typical example is below:

```text
    adn.request({ requestParams: {proximity: 50, load: 'lazy'}, adUnits: [
        {auId: '0000000000000806', auW: 728, auH: 90, requestParams: {proximity: 100, load: 'lazy'},
        {auId: '0000000000000807', auW: 100, auH: 20, requestParams: {load: 'direct'},
        {auId: '0000000000000808', auW: 40, auH: 40, requestParams: {load: 'lazyRequest'},
        {auId: '0000000000000809', auW: 230, auH: 140}
    ]});
```

Along with the standard behaviour, the request above will do the following:

* for `0000000000000806`, be part of the initial ad request to the ad server, but only show the ad and start downloading its assets when the ad unit within the web page is within 100 pixels of the viewport both vertically and horizontally
* for `0000000000000807`, be part of the initial ad request and show the ad within the appropriate ad unit as soon as the ad information comes from the ad server
* for `0000000000000808`, be part of the initial ad request only if the ad unit within the web page is within 50 pixels of the viewport both vertically and horizontally. If this is not the case, a separate ad request will be sent to the ad server when this becomes so. Then, upon receiving the ad information from the ad server, the ad itself will be displayed immediately.
* for `0000000000000809`, be part of the initial ad request, but only show the ad and start downloading its assets when the ad unit within the web page is within 50 pixels of the viewport both vertically and horizontally.

### **The Other Parameters on Multi adn.request Calls**

On a multi adn.request call, some of the adn.request parameters need to be specified in the parent object, some in the ad units and some can be specified in either location, with the ad unit value overriding the parent value if it has been specified.

Here's how the split runs:

* **Parameters specified on parent:** `method`, `usi`, `segments`, `ctx`, `longitude`, `latitude`, `excludedLineItems`, `excludedCreatives`, `onError`
* **Parameters specified on either parent or ad unit:** `requestParams`, `siteId`, `floorPrice`, `resizeOnPageLoad`, `onImpressionResponse`, `onPageLoad`, `onNoMatchedAds`, `onVisible`, `onViewable`, `clearTarget`, `functionCalls`, `replacements`, `kv`, `c`
* **Parameters specified on the ad unit only:** those no

## **Previewing an Ad**

If you just want to preview a creative in your system, you can do so in either of the following two ways:

 \#\#\#\# Requesting a Preview of a Specific Creative

```text
adn.request({
    networkId: 'myNetworkId',
    creatives: [{
        creativeId: 'myCreativeId',
        targetId: 'targetDivId',
        creativeWidth: 500, creativeHeight: 500
    }],
});
```

 \#\#\#\# Requesting a Preview of Creative Data in a Specific Layout

```text
adn.request({
    networkId: 'myNetworkId',
    creatives: [{
        creativeData: {
            creativeWidth: 67, creativeHeight: 67,
            constraintsToText: {heading: 'My Heading'}, layoutId: "dev_network_expandable_leaderboard_layout_2"
        },
        targetId: 'targetDivId'
    }],
});
```

&lt;/div&gt;

## **Getting the Ad Information in JSON Format: adn.requestData**

If you need the ad data in JSON format, you can do so using adn.requestData like so:

 \#\#\#\# Requesting Ads in JSON format for a Single Ad Unit

```text
var listeners = {
    onSuccess: function(data) {
        // do something with the data
    },
    onError: function(data) {
        // do something with the error
    },
    onResponse: function(data) {
        // do something with all json responses
    }
};
adn.requestData({
   auId: '000000000000041d', kv: [{'myKey': ['myValue1', 'myValue2']} ]
   onSuccess: listeners.onSuccess,
   onError: listeners.onError,
   onResponse: listeners.onResponse
});
```

 \#\#\#\# Requesting Ads in JSON format for Multiple Ad Units

```text
var listeners = {
    onSuccess: function(data) {
        // do something with the data
    },
    onError: function(data) {
        // do something with the error
    },
    onResponse: function(data) {
        // do something with all json responses
    }
};
adn.requestData({
   adUnits: [{auId: '000000000000041d', kv: [{'myKey': ['myValue1', 'myValue2']}] }, {auId: '000000000000041c'}],
   onSuccess: listeners.onSuccess,
   onError: listeners.onError,
   onResponse: listeners.onResponse
});
```

&lt;/div&gt;

This request works just like all the others except that the response from the ad server will be formatted as JSON and passed as a parameter into the listener functions.

For successful ad server responses, the data passed into the listener functions will be in this form:

```text
    {
        responseJSON: {justAnExampleKey: 'justAnExampleValue'},
        responseCode: 200,
        responseText: '{"justAnExampleKey": "justAnExampleValue"}'
    }
```

For failed ad server responses, the data passed into the listener functions will be in this form:

```text
    {
        errorText: 'Likely error in service',
        responseCode: 501,
        responseText: '{"bad": "allBad"}'
    }
```
