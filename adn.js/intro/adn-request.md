# Requesting an Ad

`adn.request` is the most basic way to get an ad on your page. Here's a typical example:

```text
    adn.request({ auId: '000000000000042d', auW: 364, auH: 90 });
```

This will do the following:

* ask the Adnuntius ad server for an ad from the ad unit with id `000000000000042d`
* set aside a 364Ã—90 pixels space on the web page even before an ad is received from the Adnuntius ad server
* put the ad content from the Adnuntius ad server into an HTML element with an ID of `adn-000000000000042d`

### **The adn.request Parameter Object**

The table below outlines how to tailor the basic adn.request call.

</table>## **Multi adn.request Calls**

Multi `adn.request` calls allow for the Adnuntius ad server to be asked for multiple ad units' worth of ads in one request. This makes deduplication much more effective, meaning for instance, that the same line item or creative doesn't appear on the same web page multiple times in different locations.

Here's a typical example of a multi ad request:

```text
    adn.request({ adUnits: [
        {auId: '0000000000000806', auW: 728, auH: 90},
        {auId: '0000000000000807', auW: 100, auH: 20},
        {auId: '0000000000000808', auW: 40, auH: 40}
    ]});
```

This will do the following:

* ask the Adnuntius ad server for ads to fulfil the three ad units in the `adUnits` array
* set aside space on the web page for each of the ad units even before an ad is received from the Adnuntius ad server
* put the ad content from the Adnuntius ad server into the appropriate HTML elements for each of the ad units

### **requestParams on Multi adn.request Calls**

Multi ad requests also allow for two special modes of loading ads onto your page:

* **Lazy Request:** A request for your ad unit will be made only after the user's viewport is within a particular range of the ad unit
* **Lazy Load:** One request will be made for all your ad units, but the ad itself will only be loaded into the page content after the user's viewport is within a particular range of the ad unit

These modes of loading ads can be specified via the `requestParams` parameter. A typical example is below:

```text
    adn.request({ requestParams: {proximity: 50, load: 'lazy'}, adUnits: [
        {auId: '0000000000000806', auW: 728, auH: 90, requestParams: {proximity: 100, load: 'lazy'},
        {auId: '0000000000000807', auW: 100, auH: 20, requestParams: {load: 'direct'},
        {auId: '0000000000000808', auW: 40, auH: 40, requestParams: {load: 'lazyRequest'},
        {auId: '0000000000000809', auW: 230, auH: 140}
    ]});
```

Along with the standard behaviour, the request above will do the following:

* for `0000000000000806`, be part of the initial ad request to the ad server, but only show the ad and start downloading its assets when the ad unit within the web page is within 100 pixels of the viewport both vertically and horizontally
* for `0000000000000807`, be part of the initial ad request and show the ad within the appropriate ad unit as soon as the ad information comes from the ad server
* for `0000000000000808`, be part of the initial ad request only if the ad unit within the web page is within 50 pixels of the viewport both vertically and horizontally. If this is not the case, a separate ad request will be sent to the ad server when this becomes so. Then, upon receiving the ad information from the ad server, the ad itself will be displayed immediately.
* for `0000000000000809`, be part of the initial ad request, but only show the ad and start downloading its assets when the ad unit within the web page is within 50 pixels of the viewport both vertically and horizontally.

### **The Other Parameters on Multi adn.request Calls**

On a multi adn.request call, some of the adn.request parameters need to be specified in the parent object, some in the ad units and some can be specified in either location, with the ad unit value overriding the parent value if it has been specified.

Here's how the split runs:

* **Parameters specified on parent:** `method`, `usi`, `segments`, `ctx`, `longitude`, `latitude`, `excludedLineItems`, `excludedCreatives`, `onError`
* **Parameters specified on either parent or ad unit:** `requestParams`, `siteId`, `floorPrice`, `resizeOnPageLoad`, `onImpressionResponse`, `onPageLoad`, `onNoMatchedAds`, `onVisible`, `onViewable`, `clearTarget`, `functionCalls`, `replacements`, `kv`, `c`
* **Parameters specified on the ad unit only:** those not listed above

## **Previewing an Ad**

If you just want to preview a creative in your system, you can do so in either of the following two ways:

 \#\#\#\# Requesting a Preview of a Specific Creative

```text
adn.request({
    networkId: 'myNetworkId',
    creatives: [{
        creativeId: 'myCreativeId',
        targetId: 'targetDivId',
        creativeWidth: 500, creativeHeight: 500
    }],
});
```

 \#\#\#\# Requesting a Preview of Creative Data in a Specific Layout

```text
adn.request({
    networkId: 'myNetworkId',
    creatives: [{
        creativeData: {
            creativeWidth: 67, creativeHeight: 67,
            constraintsToText: {heading: 'My Heading'}, layoutId: "dev_network_expandable_leaderboard_layout_2"
        },
        targetId: 'targetDivId'
    }],
});
```

&lt;/div&gt;

## **Getting the Ad Information in JSON Format: adn.requestData**

If you need the ad data in JSON format, you can do so using adn.requestData like so:

 \#\#\#\# Requesting Ads in JSON format for a Single Ad Unit

```text
var listeners = {
    onSuccess: function(data) {
        // do something with the data
    },
    onError: function(data) {
        // do something with the error
    },
    onResponse: function(data) {
        // do something with all json responses
    }
};
adn.requestData({
   auId: '000000000000041d', kv: [{'myKey': ['myValue1', 'myValue2']} ]
   onSuccess: listeners.onSuccess,
   onError: listeners.onError,
   onResponse: listeners.onResponse
});
```

 \#\#\#\# Requesting Ads in JSON format for Multiple Ad Units

```text
var listeners = {
    onSuccess: function(data) {
        // do something with the data
    },
    onError: function(data) {
        // do something with the error
    },
    onResponse: function(data) {
        // do something with all json responses
    }
};
adn.requestData({
   adUnits: [{auId: '000000000000041d', kv: [{'myKey': ['myValue1', 'myValue2']}] }, {auId: '000000000000041c'}],
   onSuccess: listeners.onSuccess,
   onError: listeners.onError,
   onResponse: listeners.onResponse
});
```

&lt;/div&gt;

This request works just like all the others except that the response from the ad server will be formatted as JSON and passed as a parameter into the listener functions.

For successful ad server responses, the data passed into the listener functions will be in this form:

```text
    {
        responseJSON: {justAnExampleKey: 'justAnExampleValue'},
        responseCode: 200,
        responseText: '{"justAnExampleKey": "justAnExampleValue"}'
    }
```

For failed ad server responses, the data passed into the listener functions will be in this form:

```text
    {
        errorText: 'Likely error in service',
        responseCode: 501,
        responseText: '{"bad": "allBad"}'
    }
```
