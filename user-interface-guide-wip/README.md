# User Interface Guide \(WIP\)

Adnuntius Connect is an information and tag management system that helps you with the following tasks:

* Manage privacy and consent by enabling your visitors to see the purposes for which you collect user information, and to control which purposes they consent to. 
* Manage integrations between various Adnuntius systems and external systems. For instance, you can use Adnuntius Connect to send user data from Adnuntius Data to Facebook so that you can use Facebook’s Custom Audiences. 
* Manage header bidding \(prebid\) with a system where you can make changes to your prebid setup without changing your projects. 
* Organize your software vendors’ tags on your site.

To log in, go to [https://connect.adnuntius.com/](https://connect.adnuntius.com/) and type in your Adnuntius username and password. If you do not have one, please contact your system administrator, and if you are not a customer but would like to become one, please contact us at support@adnuntius.com.

You will find documentation for each function in the menu on the left.
