# Ad Server for Agencies

You will find full documentation of the underlying platform (Adnuntius Advertising) [here](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/). The purpose of this guide however, is to make it easier for new customers to get started. This guide is split into basic features which cover the steps to get started, and the more advanced features which help you get more value from Adnuntius.

## 1 Basic Features

### 1.1 Inventory

When you add a creative to Adnuntius and want to generate a creative tag that you can send to a publisher, then you are asked to select an ad unit before the tag is created.

![When creating creative tags you are asked to select an ad unit first.](<../.gitbook/assets/202206 Creative Tag Agencies.png>)

in order to create creative tags you must therefore first create those ad units (and a couple of other things as well to keep things tidy inside your system). When you later run a campaign you can split reporting per ad unit so that you better know what inventory performs and what does not. Here are three examples on how you can choose to set up your inventory.&#x20;

1. Let's say that you create three ad units: _sitex.com - top banner - frontpage, sitex.com - top banner - sports section, and sitey.com - skyscraper - frontpage_. When you run campaigns you will have reporting split by site (sitex vs sitey), by placement (top banner vs skyscraper), and by section (frontpage vs sports section). This one-time setup takes longer, but you are rewarded with more granular reporting.
2. Let's say that you create two ad units: _sitex.com - top banner, and sitey.com - top banner - frontpage_. Now your one-time setup goes faster since you reduce the granularity, but you get less detailed reporting in return.&#x20;
3. Let's say that you create one ad unit: _top banner_. Now you spend only minutes on the inventory section, but you only get high-level reporting back (more specifically; you only see the ad unit "top banner" in reports without having it split by site, section or anything else).

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that this applies only when you use Adnuntius as an adserver. If you are connected to an **Adnuntius** **Marketplace** then you will not have to create inventory at all, as this has been done by publishers that operate live within that marketplace.

You can, if you'd like, start quickly with alternative 3 and then work to produce more granular inventory over time. Below is an overview of the most relevant objects you will find in the inventory section. [Here you will also find a schematic of how these objects relate to one another. ](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/inventory/)
