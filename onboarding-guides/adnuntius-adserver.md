# Adnuntius Ad Server

You will find full documentation of the underlying platform (Adnuntius Advertising) [here](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/). The purpose of this guide however, is to make implementation easier for new customers. The steps below contains the basic steps. There are more advanced functions that you can read up on under the full documentation, but these steps should make you familiar with the platform's basic features.&#x20;

If you are working as an ad operations representative for a publisher or buyer, and your normal day-to-day job involves campaign booking, management and reporting, then you can most likely jump to step 5 below. Step 5 involves creating an ad unit, which is probably not part of your daily routine, but it is useful to know how ad units work since creatives will be served inside these ad units.&#x20;

This guide assumes that you have been given access to Adnuntius Advertising. However, if you haven't please contact us at [support@adnuntius.com](mailto:support@adnuntius.com).

| What and Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Choices                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **1.** Understand the inventory section. The link to the right leads you to a page that teaches you the main parts of the inventory section.                                                                                                                        | [Documentation](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/inventory/)                                                                                                                              |
| **2.** Create an earnings account. Earnings accounts let you aggregate earnings that one or more sites have made. Here is how you create an earnings account.                                                                                                       | <p><a href="https://admin.adnuntius.com/earnings-accounts">Start testing</a></p><p><a href="../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/inventory/earnings-accounts.md">Documentation</a></p>        |
| **3.** Create a site group. If you only have one site you can skip this. If you have more than one, you can start by creating one site group called "All sites".                                                                                                    | <p><a href="https://admin.adnuntius.com/site-groups">Start testing</a></p><p><a href="../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/inventory/site-groups.md">Documentation</a></p>                    |
| **4.** Create a site. A site is a domain where you would like ads to go. Start by creating one site so that you learn the process, and then you can create more later.                                                                                              | <p><a href="https://admin.adnuntius.com/sites">Start testing</a></p><p><a href="../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/inventory/sites.md">Documentation</a></p>                                |
| **5.** Create an ad unit. Start by creating one ad unit so that you learn the process, and then you can create more later.                                                                                                                                          | <p><a href="https://admin.adnuntius.com/ad-units">Start testing</a></p><p><a href="../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/inventory/adunits-1.md">Documentation</a></p>                         |
| **6.** Understand the advertising section. The link to the right leads you to a page that teaches you the main parts of the advertising section.                                                                                                                    | [Documentation](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/advertising/)                                                                                                                            |
| **7.** Create an advertiser. An advertiser is a client that wants to advertise on your sites. If you have no advertisers yet, try creating your own company as an advertiser (which may be useful for house ads anyway).                                            | <p><a href="https://admin.adnuntius.com/advertisers">Start testing</a></p><p><a href="../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/advertising/advertisers.md">Documentation</a><strong></strong></p> |
| **8.** Create an order. An advertiser can contain one or more orders. An order is also a folder for line items, and also determines which team that the campaign should belong to.                                                                                  | <p><a href="https://admin.adnuntius.com/orders">Start testing</a></p><p><a href="../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/advertising/orders.md">Documentation</a></p>                            |
| **9.** Create a line item (with targeting and creatives). A line item determines start and end dates, delivery objectives and more. Try targeting the creative to the ad unit you created in step 5, and remember to use a size that is supported by that ad unit.  | <p><a href="https://admin.adnuntius.com/line-items">Start testing</a></p><p><a href="../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/advertising/line-items.md">Documentation</a></p>                    |
| **10.** Try to generate an ad impression using the Ad Tag Generator. Just choose your ad unit, copy its properties, and then click the tab "Request Ads". Do you see your ad?                                                                                       | <p><a href="https://admin.adnuntius.com/ad-tag">Start testing</a></p><p><a href="../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/inventory/ad-tag-generator.md">Documentation</a></p>                    |

These first steps should show you the basics of getting up and running. You can now create more sites, ad units and line items, so that you will soon have set up your account for implementation ([documented here](../adnuntius-advertising/requesting-ads/)).&#x20;
