## Network Operators

If you are running your own private network, then you will need to know some key administration tasks. This guide takes you through these.

### Creating Publishing Users

Whenever you get a new publisher onboard your network, you can create users for them so that they can access and manage their own publishing inventory. Here is how you create roles, teams and users with the right permissions.

**Roles.** This is a one-time setup job, so if you already have the roles below in place, you can skip this point whenever you set up new users. You will need two roles in order to create users with the right permissions; a network role and a team role. 

1. Admin role. Go to [Admin &gt; Roles](https://admin.adnuntius.com/admin/roles) and click “new”. Give the role a name of your choice \(for instance “Network Publisher Admin”, choose role type “internal”, role scope “network” and then finally the permission “AX Publisher Admin”. Then click save. Click [here](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/admin/users-teams-and-roles.md) for more information. 
2. Team role. Go to [Admin &gt; Roles](https://admin.adnuntius.com/admin/roles) and click “new”. Give the role a name of your choice \(for instance “Network Publisher Admin”, choose role type “internal”, role scope “team” and then finally the permission “AX Publisher”. Then click save. Click [here ](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/admin/users-teams-and-roles.md)for more information.

**Teams.** Once your roles are set up, you can proceed to create teams. Teams determine the content that users shall have access to. Whenever you bring a new publisher onboard you should create a new team, so that invited users can access this inventory, but not the inventory of other publishers, or buyers.

1. Go to [Admin &gt; Teams](https://admin.adnuntius.com/admin/teams) and click “new”. Give the team a name of your choice, for example “Team \[publisherName\]”. Click [here](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/admin/users-teams-and-roles.md) for more information on teams. 
2. Choose type “AX Publisher”.
3. If you have created the publisher’s site\(s\) on behalf of the publisher, then you can choose those sites to ensure that the publisher will have access to these. If you want to let publishers create this content on their own, just click save without choosing any sites.

**Users.** Once you have created a team for the publisher, you can go to the last step, which is to create a user. Please note that once you have created one user for the publisher, that user can invite more users with the same permissions. So, you only need to create the first user before letting that user create more.

1. Go to [Admin &gt; Users](https://admin.adnuntius.com/admin/users) and click “new”. Provide the user’s email address, name and display name \(display name is the name that will be displayed in the upper right corner of the user interface\). Click [here](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/admin/users-teams-and-roles.md) for more information on users.
2. Choose the advertising network role that you created earlier \(“Network Publisher Admin” if you followed the naming example above\).
3. Under the team you’ve created for the user, choose the role you created earlier \(“Team Publisher Admin” if you followed the naming example above\). 
4. Lastly, click save. When you’ve clicked save an invitation email will be automatically be sent to the user.

### Creating Advertiser Users

Whenever you get a new buyer onboard your network, you can create users for them so that they can access and manage their own advertisers \(for agencies\) and campaigns. Here is how you create roles, teams and users with the right permissions.

**Roles.** This is a one-time setup job, so if you already have the roles below in place, you can skip this point whenever you set up new users. You will need two roles in order to create users with the right permissions; a network role and a team role.

1. Admin role. Go to [Admin &gt; Roles](https://admin.adnuntius.com/admin/roles) and click “new”. Give the role a name of your choice \(for instance “Network Advertiser Admin”, choose role type “internal”, role scope “network” and then finally the permission “AX Advertiser Admin”. Then click save. Click [here](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/admin/users-teams-and-roles.md) for more information.
2. Team role. Go to [Admin &gt; Roles](https://admin.adnuntius.com/admin/roles) and click “new”. Give the role a name of your choice \(for instance “Network Advertiser Admin”, choose role type “internal”, role scope “team” and then finally the permission “AX Advertiser”. Then click save. Click [here](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/admin/users-teams-and-roles.md) for more information.

**Teams.** Once your roles are set up, you can proceed to create teams. Teams determine the content that users shall have access to. Whenever you bring a new advertiser onboard you should create a new team, so that invited users can access this inventory, but not the inventory of other advertisers, or publishers.

1. Go to [Admin &gt; Teams](https://admin.adnuntius.com/admin/teams) and click “new”. Give the team a name of your choice, for example “Team \[advertiserName\]”. Click [here](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/admin/users-teams-and-roles.md) for more information.
2. Choose type “AX Advertiser”. Then click save.

**Users.** Once you have created a team for the advertiser, you can go to the last step, which is to create a user. Please note that once you have created one user for the advertiser, that user can invite more users with the same permissions. So, you only need to create the first user before letting that user create more.

1. Go to [Admin &gt; Users](https://admin.adnuntius.com/admin/users) and click “new”. Provide the user’s email address, name and display name \(display name is the name that will be displayed in the upper right corner of the user interface\). Click [here](../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/admin/users-teams-and-roles.md) for more information.
2. Choose the advertising network role that you created earlier \(“Network Advertiser Admin” if you followed the naming example above\).
3. Under the team you’ve created for the user, choose the role you created earlier \(“Team Advertiser Admin” if you followed the naming example above\). 
4. Lastly, click save. When you’ve clicked save an invitation email will be automatically be sent to the user.

### Training New Users

If you want to provide new users with written instructions on how to use the platform as advertisers or publishers, you can simply send them the link to this page. The two first sections of this page provide new users with a checklist training program that takes them through the steps to becoming familiar and comfortable with the system.

### Contractual Relationships

Whenever you get a new advertiser or publisher on board, you should sign a contract with them that regulates pricing, service level agreements and more. Adnuntius provides standard contracts to its operating partners, that may be used to facilitate this job. If you have not received these templates already, please send an email to [support@adnuntius.com](mailto:support@adnuntius.com) and we will help you out.
