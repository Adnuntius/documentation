This section assumes that you have an agreement with Adnuntius, and have been granted access to admin.adnuntius.com. If you are looking for an offer, please contact us at [support@adnuntius.com](mailto:support@adnuntius.com) and we will help you out. There are four main steps: 

1. Create your publishing inventory.
2. Make sure that ad requests are sent to your Adnuntius account.
3. Set up the self-service portal. 
4. Understand how it all works.

## Create Publishing Inventory

If you are already set up with Adnuntius Advertising and will not make any changes to your publishing inventory, you can skip this step.

## Ensure that Ad Requests are Sent to Adnuntius

If you are already set up with Adnuntius Advertising and will not make any changes to your publishing inventory, you can skip this step. [There are different ways of ensuring that ad requests are sent to Adnuntius, so that self-service advertisers can later buy this traffic.](../../adnuntius-advertising/requesting-ads/)

## Approval Process

Once a self-service advertiser has created and submitted a campaign you will need to approve the creative material before the campaign goes live. Go to [https://admin.adnuntius.com/reviews](https://admin.adnuntius.com/reviews) and to see all creatives pending review. If you approve a creative then the advertiser's campaign will go live immediately, and the advertiser will be notified about the decision.

![Reviewing creatives in the admin user interface.](../../.gitbook/assets/202007-ss-creative-review.gif)

If you click to reject a creative then you can choose a reason why this creative was rejected. The screenshot below shows you the range of reasons for rejection that you can apply. Once you have selected a reason then the advertiser will be notified of your decision, and they will also see the reason for rejection so that they can make the appropriate changes.

![Reasons for rejecting a campaign. ](../../.gitbook/assets/ss-rejection-reason.png)

## Understanding the Workflow

This section explains how objects like users, advertisers, teams, campaigns and more are created when a self-service advertisers choose to join and to create campaigns. This helps you understand how to find various objects in admin.adnuntius.com when it is needed. As the image below illustrates there are three types of objects \(see the left-most side of the image below\) you should know about. 

* Certain objects are prepared in advance by you as a publisher. These include products and teams. 
* When a self-service advertiser chooses to sign up, they will create a user access, after which they can also create campaigns. 
* When self-service advertisers create the items above, you as a publisher will find these in admin.adnuntius.com.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ss-workflow.png)

| Steps and explanations | Resources |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1 Self-service advertiser registers** with a name, email, company name \(you can choose if company name is needed\) and password. This is the one time job that each user has to go through in order to create user access.  | [Example registration page](https://assets.adnuntius.com/xOVX5p4fQbjhI8Nz6_iBU34re-unkwsad633WKXeV4s.png) |
| 1.1 All self-service users are automatically created as part of one team. As part of the implementation process we will set up a team for you. All users registering as self-service advertisers will automatically become part of this team. | [See how this is organized](./#user-management) |
| 1.2 An Advertiser is automatically created with the company’s name. The Advertiser is automatically tied to the team above. Please note that we do not require this step; if you are allowed to, and want to, allow private persons to create ads then you can do so.  | [How Advertisers are stored](../../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/advertising/advertisers.md) |
| **2 Self-service advertiser creates and submits a campaign.** This involves choosing a product, design \(layout\) and targeting made avaiable by you through one or more products, applying a budget, and paying for the campaign \(if you want advertisers to prepay\).  | [More about products](../../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/admin/products.md) |
| 2.1 All campaigns are automatically assigned to one Order as designed on the Product. As a publisher you can visit and manage this order.  |  |
| 2.2 A Line Item is created for this campaign. As a publisher you can make any changes to each line item, such as changing targeting or creatives. |  |
| **3 Self-service advertiser receives reporting, and manages the campaign.** Campaigns are now running and registering reporting. |  |

## User Management

A self-service advertiser will be able to register on their own through your self-service portal. However, they will not be able to log into admin.adnuntius.com, as this is an admin area for you alone. Once they have created a user however, you will be able to see and manage that user in admin.adnuntius.com. Here are the actions you can do to a user once it is created. 

* Search for users by their name or email address in the upper right corner, or you can browse through users under [https://admin.adnuntius.com/admin/users](https://admin.adnuntius.com/admin/users).
* Change the email address and name of the user. Changing the email means that the self-service advertiser will need to log in with the new email address, and this change is not automatically communicated through automated emails.
* Update the user's password. Please note that if you update the user's password from within the admin user interface, that user will not be notified about changed passwords. If they should be notified, you should tell the user to click the "forgot your password" link from your portal's login page. 
* Activate or de-activate the user. If you de-activate the user, then that user can no longer log in.
* Change the user's locale. Whenever users register they will be able to set their location, and this may determine the language of emails and the user interface. If they for any reason have set the wrong locale you can manually change it here. 
* You can also change their roles and teams, but this is not recommended as this may give users access to parts of the systems that they should not have.

![Example self-service advertiser within admin.adnuntius.com](../../.gitbook/assets/self-service-user-example.png)

**More about roles**. When a self-service advertiser registers they will automatically be set up with a network role and a team role. The network role will be an empy network role, while the team role will contain the "Self-Service Own Advertising" rights. To understand users, roles and team in detail, please see [here](../../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/admin/users-teams-and-roles.md).
