# Adnuntius Self-Service

This section assumes that you have an agreement with Adnuntius, and have been granted access to admin.adnuntius.com, and the self-service product. If you are looking for an offer, please contact us at [support@adnuntius.com](mailto:support@adnuntius.com) and we will help you out. There are three main steps to get started.

1. Create publishing inventory.

## Create Publishing Inventory

If you are already set up with Adnuntius Advertising and will not make any changes to your publishing inventory, you can skip this step.

### Understand the Overall Workflow

This section explains how objects like users, advertisers, teams, campaigns and more are created when a self-service advertisers choose to join and to create campaigns. This helps you understand how to find various objects in admin.adnuntius.com when it is needed. As the image below illustrates there are three types of objects \(see the left-most side of the image below\) you should know about. 

* Certain objects are prepared in advance by you as a publisher. These include products and teams. 
* When a self-service advertiser signs up they can perform certain actions.
* Whatever self-service advertisers create, you as administrator will find it in admin.adnuntius.com.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ss-workflow.png)

| Steps and explanations | Resources |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1 Self-service advertiser registers** with a name, email, company name \(you can choose if company name is needed\) and password. This is the one time job that each user has to go through in order to advertise with you. | [Example registration page](https://assets.adnuntius.com/xOVX5p4fQbjhI8Nz6_iBU34re-unkwsad633WKXeV4s.png) |
| 1.1 All self-service users are automatically created as part of a team \(we will set up a team for you as part of the implementation process\). All users registering as self-service advertisers will automatically become part of this team. | [See how this is organized](./#user-management) |
| 1.2 An Advertiser is automatically created with the company’s name, and tied to the team above. Note that this step applies only if you require the self-service advertiser to provide a company name when registering. | [How Advertisers are stored](../../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/advertising/advertisers.md) |
| **2 Self-service advertiser creates and submits a campaign.** This involves choosing a product, design and targeting, applying a budget, and paying for the campaign \(if you want advertisers to prepay\). You will then have to review this campaign. | [More about products](../../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/admin/products.md) |
| 2.1 All campaigns are automatically assigned to one Order as designed on the Product. As an administrator you can visit and manage this order.  | [More about orders](../../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/advertising/orders.md) |
| 2.2 A Line Item is created for this campaign. As an administrator you can make any changes to each line item, such as changing targeting or creatives. | [More about line items](../../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/advertising/line-items.md) |
| **3 Self-service advertiser receives reporting, and manages the campaign.** Campaigns are now running and registering reporting. |  |

### Create a Self-Service Advertiser

Try to create a self-service advertiser, so that you understand the process your customers will go through, and so that you know where to find objects in admin.adnuntius.com. If you don't know the link to your self-service portal, you will find it here: [https://admin.adnuntius.com/admin/network](https://admin.adnuntius.com/admin/network). if you still cannot see it, contact us at [support@adnuntius.com](mailto:support@adnuntius.com). To understand how to create a new user, [follow this short process](user-interface-guide.md#registering-and-logging-in).

{% hint style="info" %}
Do you receive a message that "your account is not registered here"? This means that your email address is registered in Adnuntius already, perhaps under a test network or similar. If this happens, contact us at [support@adnuntius.com](mailto:support@adnuntius.com) and we will help you. Or, you can try with another email address that you own.
{% endhint %}

Once you have created a user it is time to have a look inside the [admin.adnuntius.com](https://admin.adnuntius.com/) user interface to understand where you find what has just been created.

* Find the **user** by searching for your email address or name in the upper right corner inside admin.adnuntius.com, or [clicking here](https://admin.adnuntius.com/admin/users).
* Find the **company** that was just created by searching, or by [clicking here](https://admin.adnuntius.com/advertisers). Applies only if you ask for company name in the registration process.

![Example self-service advertiser within admin.adnuntius.com](../../.gitbook/assets/self-service-user-example.png)

### Create and Review a Campaign

Try to create a campaign by following [this user guide](user-interface-guide.md#creating-a-campaign). 

Once you have created a campaign it is time to have a look inside the [admin.adnuntius.com](https://admin.adnuntius.com/) user interface to understand where you find what has just been created. Start by **reviewing submitted campaigns:** Once a campaign is created it will land in a review queue, where you can see the creative, click URL and more, and approve the campaign or reject for a specific reason. [Go to reviews now](https://admin.adnuntius.com/reviews). 

![Approve campaigns, or apply a reason for rejecting them.](../../.gitbook/assets/202103-ss-review.gif)

If you reject a campaign then the advertiser will be notified through email, and will then be able to correct the campaign \(they will see the reason for rejection\) and re-submit it.

![What a rejected campaign will look like to an advertiser.](../../.gitbook/assets/rejected%20%281%29.png)

### Manage Campaigns

Once a campaign is submitted you will be able to manage it inside [admin.adnuntius.com](https://admin.adnuntius.com/). 

* You will see all self-service campaigns here: [https://admin.adnuntius.com/campaigns](https://admin.adnuntius.com/campaigns)
* You will also see them among all line items here: [https://admin.adnuntius.com/line-items](https://admin.adnuntius.com/line-items)
* If you ask self-service advertisers to provide a company name you can find their campaigns under each advertiser. go to [https://admin.adnuntius.com/advertisers](https://admin.adnuntius.com/advertisers), click on the relevant advertiser and then click on the "line items" tab.
* You can run reports of all line items here: [https://admin.adnuntius.com/queries/line-item](https://admin.adnuntius.com/queries/line-item).
