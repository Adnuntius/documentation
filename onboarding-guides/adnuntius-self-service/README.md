# Self-Service \(in Progress\)

## This section is work in progress, and will soon be ready for your eyes. 

This section assumes that you are set up so that ads are being requested from Adnuntius using [javascript tags](../../adnuntius-advertising/requesting-ads/intro/), prebid, openrtb or [API integration](../../adnuntius-advertising/requesting-ads/http-api.md). If you still need help with this, please contact us at [support@adnuntius.com](mailto:support@adnuntius.com). Please follow the steps below to get set up.

      <td style="text-align:left">1 Create products. Products package dimensions, pricing, layouts and targeting
        so that buying ads can be made simple. Whenever a self-service advertiser
        creates a campaign, choosing a product is the first step in creating that
        campaign.</td>

        get comfortable with the user interface by creating a test user, and to
        try booking a campaign. Also, you can refer to the documentation page we
        provide, or copy the text to your own domain to provide self-service advertisers
        with a user guide.</td>

      <td style="text-align:left">4 Learn the approval process. When a self-service advertiser has created
        a campaign, then you as a publisher need to approve its creatives. This
        ensures that creatives do not contain illegal or unethical content, or
        anything you don&apos;t like.</td>
