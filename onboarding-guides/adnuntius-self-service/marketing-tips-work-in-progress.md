# Marketing Tips (Work in Progress)

Adnuntius works as a partner together with its self-service publishers, which means that we succeed if you succeed - and if you fail, we fail too. That is why it's important for us that our partners do their part of the work to make their self-service portals a success, and part of that work involves marketing. We provide the technology and end-to-end workflow; you let the world know that you're open for business. 

| Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Example      |

| **"Book Campaign" button on menu. **Your website likely has a menu. We recommend that you add a link from your menu leading to your self-service portal                                                              | Coming soon. |
| **House ads.** You likely have some inventory that isn't currently monetized. We recommend that you utilize this inventory to market your portal in the same way as you help your ad clients market their offerings. | Coming soon. |
| **Newsletters.** There are many reasons to collect email addresses, and one of them is that it allows you to market your own services such as your self-service ad portal.                                           | Coming soon. |
| **Social media.** If you have a following on social media, make sure that you consider the opportunity of letting your followers know that they can advertise with you.                                              | Coming soon. |
| **Print campaigns.** If you're in print media, remember that you can also use that channel.                                                                                                                          | Coming soon. |

Finally, remember that all marketing can be combined with the [coupon ](../../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/admin/coupons.md)feature, which allows you to offer a discount to new advertisers when they join your portal.
