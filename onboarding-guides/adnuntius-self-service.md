## This section is work in progress, and will soon be ready for your eyes. 

This section assumes that you are set up so that ads are being requested from Adnuntius using [javascript tags](../adnuntius-advertising/requesting-ads/intro/), prebid, openrtb or [API integration](../adnuntius-advertising/requesting-ads/http-api.md). If you still need help with this, please contact us at [support@adnuntius.com](mailto:support@adnuntius.com). Please follow the steps below to get set up.
