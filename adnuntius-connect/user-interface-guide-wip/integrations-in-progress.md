# Integrations \(in progress\)

Adnuntius Connect comes with native integrations between Adnuntius Data and Advertising, and different external systems. For example, if you want to send Adnuntius Data segments to your Pubmatic SSP so that your segments are available for targeting in Pubmatic, this is where you can create such an integration.

To create an integration, go to Integrations and click “Create new”. Give your integration a name, and select the external target system from the source dropdown list. Once you have clicked “Create”, click on your newly created integration.

The fields to be filled in depends on the external system you chose. Below is a list of external systems you can choose from and the values you need to apply. Also, if you cannot find your external system below, please notify us at support@adnuntius.com and we will help you out.
