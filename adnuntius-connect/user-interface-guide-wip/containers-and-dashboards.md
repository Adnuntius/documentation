# Containers and Dashboards

The first thing you need to do is to create one of more containers. A container is a container for your tags, and is most often associated with a site. This means that if you own three different sites, you most commonly would have three different containers, one for each site.

To create a container, click “Create New”. Give the container a name and cilck “Create”.

If you have access to more than one Adnuntius network you can switch between them in the upper right corner.
