# User Profile

Your user profile lets you personalize certain aspects of the user interface. You can add an **avatar**, and change your **name** and **display name**. You can furthermore change the **locale** to manage numbers and date formats.&#x20;

The **default list size** lets you determine how many lines should show in a list. For example, if you set the list size to 50, then the list of line items under [https://admin.adnuntius.com/line-items](https://admin.adnuntius.com/line-items) and the list of sites under [https://admin.adnuntius.com/sites](https://admin.adnuntius.com/sites) will list up to 50 results at a time.

You can choose to show or hide the **support widget** in the lower right corner of the screen.

You can choose between two different **menu versions**.
