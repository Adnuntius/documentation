# User Profile

Your user profile lets you personalize certain aspects of the user interface. You can add an **avatar**, and change your **name** and **display name**. You can furthermore change the **locale** to manage numbers and date formats.&#x20;

The **default list size** lets you determine how many lines should show in a list. For example, if you set the list size to 50, then the list of line items under [https://admin.adnuntius.com/line-items](https://admin.adnuntius.com/line-items) and the list of sites under [https://admin.adnuntius.com/sites](https://admin.adnuntius.com/sites) will list up to 50 results at a time.

You can choose to show or hide the **support widget** in the lower right corner of the screen.

You can choose between two different **menu versions**.

## Adding a Passkey

A passkey enables you to log in easier using your password manager, with your fingerprint, or similar. Here is how you add one. First, click **Register a Passkey**.&#x20;

Depending on the alternatives available on your computer you will get a few alternatives, such as password manager or fingerprint.&#x20;

Next, in the popup window that appears, click **Request Email Code.** Check your mail (sometimes it will take a few seconds before you get one), copy the email code and paste it into the field that says Email Code.

When you get the confirmation shown above and close the modal window, you will see your passkey enabled on your user profile. You can change or disable it later as you wish.&#x20;

Now, next time you log into Adnuntius, click **Sign in with Passkey,** then add your fingerprint, password manager entry or facial recognition (depending on how you've set up the passkey), then finally click to log in.&#x20;
