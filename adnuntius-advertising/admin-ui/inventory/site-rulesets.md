# Site Rulesets

To create a new ruleset, go to [https://admin.adnuntius.com/rulesets](https://admin.adnuntius.com/rulesets) and click "new" in the upper right corner. Give your ruleset a name and optional description of your choice.

The **Team** determines who will have access to your ruleset.

Choose ruleset **Type** to determine whether your ruleset should apply to inventory, targeting or creative size:

* Inventory lets you define a floor price across all advertisers, or a floor price for a specific advertiser.
* Targeting means that if you apply a floor price to e.g. semantic targeting, this means that whenever a buyer creates a campaign using semantic targeting, then this campaign cannot bid below the floor price you set.&#x20;
* Creative size lets you set a floor price for a specific width and height.&#x20;

Once you have saved your ruleset, then this ruleset can be applied to the Publisher/Earnings Account, any of your Sites, or any of your Ad Units. On each of these you will have the ability to choose rulesets as shown here:&#x20;
