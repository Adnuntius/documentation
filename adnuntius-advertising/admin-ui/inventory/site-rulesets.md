# Site Rulesets

To create a new ruleset, go to [https://admin.adnuntius.com/site-rulesets](https://admin.adnuntius.com/site-rulesets) and click "new" in the upper right corner. Give your ruleset a name and optional description of your choice.

The **Team** determines who will have access to your ruleset.

The **floor price** lets you set a minimum price for all your ad units in one place. If you for example set a floor of 3 EUR on your site ruleset, and then a floor of 5 EUR on a specific ad unit, then that ad unit's floor will be 5 EUR.&#x20;

**Restrictions** lets you block or allow certain advertisers and campaigns.&#x20;

* If you set your restrictions to "block" then you will block all your entries but allow anything else.&#x20;
* If you set your restrictions to "allow" then you will allow only the entries you have entered.&#x20;
