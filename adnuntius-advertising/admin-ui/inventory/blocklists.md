# Blocklists

To create a blocklist, go to [https://admin.adnuntius.com/blocklists](https://admin.adnuntius.com/blocklists) and click "new" in the upper right corner. Give the blocklist a name and optional description.&#x20;

The **Team** determines who will have access to your blocklist.

Next, apply what categories, domans, advertisers, line items, creatives or teams that should be blocked.&#x20;

Once you have saved your blocklist, then this ruleset can be applied to the Publisher/Earnings Account, any of your Sites, or any of your Ad Units. On each of these you will have the ability to choose rulesets as shown here:&#x20;
