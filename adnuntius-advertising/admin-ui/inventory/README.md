## Concept Summary

| Name                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |

| [Earnings account](earnings-accounts.md) | Lets you aggregate earnings that one or more sites have made. Here is how you create an earnings account.                                                                                 |
| [Site group](site-groups.md)             | Lets publishers group sites together to make targeting line items and/or creatives to multiple sites easier.                                                                              |
| [Site](sites.md)                         | A site or domain with a given name, containing one or more ad units.                                                                                                                      |
| [Ad Unit](adunits-1.md)                  | A placement that goes onto your site, so that you can later fill it with ads. It is as such an empty container that sets aside a space on your site so that you can fill it with content. |
| [External Ad Unit](external-adunits.md)  | A placement connecting ad units to programmatic inventory, enabling you to serve ads from one or more SSPs with client-side and/or server-side connections.                               |
| Ad tag generator                         | When you have created your ad units, you can use the ad tag generator to get the codes ready for deployment.                                                                              |

Here is how the various objects hang together: an earnings account and site group can both contain multiple sites; a site can contain multiple ad units, and ad units can connect to creatives (for direct advertising) or to external ad units (for programmatic ads).
