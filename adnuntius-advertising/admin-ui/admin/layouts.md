# Layouts and Examples

## Layouts

When creating a creative, you will always choose a layout, and your layout will be come visible when you have saved your layout.

![Layout example](../../../.gitbook/assets/201811-reports-admin-layouts%20%281%29.png)

**Name, description, category and labels**: Give the layout a name and description \(optional\) of your choice. Categories allow you to group layouts with similar traits so that they are easier to find when later booking a line item and creating a creative.

**Default width and height \(optional\)**: When you add a creative you will always have to provide a width and height to that creative. Creatives using this layout will have these dimensions by default, so that if a creative is usually created with this size, then the process will go quicker. You can of course always change the width and height on a per-creative basis.

**Layout type** is where you determine whether your new layout will be a third party \(to render third-party creative content\), HTML \(to render HTML creatives that can be uploaded via a zip\), VAST 2.0 \(to render VAST 2 video creatives\), or regular \(to define your own components and render template for making a creative.

**Layout usage** gives you information about the creatives currently using this layout.

**Render template** is the code that you can insert to determine the look and feel, and any event, of your choice.

**Components in render template** are assets that you can add to the layout. You can add URLs \(for example click destinations\), text \(for example for native ads\), choices \(for instance choices on whether a video should autoplay or not\), or media \(being images in GIF, JPG or PNG\).

## Layout Includes

The feature is live, documentation will come soon. 

## Examples

Layout examples provides you with a library of layouts that cannot be modified or removed. You can visit each of the layouts, observe its behavior on-screen, and copy it to create a new layout that can be used for your creatives.
