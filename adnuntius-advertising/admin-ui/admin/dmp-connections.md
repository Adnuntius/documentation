# DMP Connections

Adnuntius is currently connected to Cxense DMP.

![Context service connection](../../../.gitbook/assets/201811-reports-admin-context-service-connection.png)

**Name and description**: Give the connection a name and description \(optional\) of your choice.

**Username and API key**: Provide the username \(email address\) that you use when logging into your Cxense account. Then add the API key for your user. You will find this in the upper right corner after logging into Cxense, when clicking on your email address.

{% hint style="info" %}
Adnuntius synchs with Cxense every 5 minutes. So it may take a few minutes before you can see your segments.
{% endhint %}
