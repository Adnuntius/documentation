# Reference Data

When you use [category or key value targeting](../advertising/#line-item) on line items or creatives, it can be hard to remember how a categories \(as defined by the URL structure\) are designed on your site, or which key values are being sent with the ad requests. Reference data lets you upload a text file that creates a library of categories and key values that you can choose from, rather than remember them all.

![Example category targeting where reference data has been added](../../../.gitbook/assets/201811-reports-admin-reference-data.png)

**Category uploader**: Just create a .txt file where each line specifies a new category that you want to add.

**Key value uploader**: Just create a .txt file where each line specifies a new key-value entry and commas separate the data like so: mykey, myfirstvalue, mysecondvalue
