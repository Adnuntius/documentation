You can set up as many exports as you want, to Amazon S3, S3 compatible buckets, Google Cloud and/or to Azure. You can also download logs at sftp://data.adnuntius.com:8164, using your Adnuntius username and password to authenticate.&#x20;

**Event types** lets you choose whether to export all events (in which case you may incur higher cost for data storage) or just some.&#x20;

Below you will see the fields to be filled in when exporting to S3, S3 compatible buckets, Google Cloud and to Azure.&#x20;

## Get Help Setting Up

We can help you set up exports and ensure that you have useful and good looking dashboards. Here is a short description of what we can do for you. If this sounds like your cup of tea, please contact us at [support@adnuntius.com](mailto:support@adnuntius.com) for more information and pricing.

**1 Setting up the data warehouse (DWH).** If you don't have a DWH set up we can help you. We will help you set up a DWH of your choice between AWS S3, Azure and Google Cloud. Please note that the account will be in your name, that you will formally own the account, and that you will cover the cost of it. We do this because we want you to be the controller and owner of the data, and that you should be able to own the data if you choose to end your subscription with us at a later time.&#x20;

**2 Exporting to the DWH.** Once we have the account details (as shown above) either through helping you set up the DWH or by you sharing them with us, we will set up the export for you and verify that the data is stored correctly. We will clarify with you if there are any data that should be disregarded so that you can save on data storage costs.

**3 Set up dashboards.** Once the data is in place you will be able to build dashboards and run analyses using your preferred BI or analytics tool. We can also help you set up a standard set of dashboards to help you get started.&#x20;

**Important**: please note that we help you build this integration, but unless something else is explicitly agreed on you will own the integrations and DWH going forward. This also means, for example, that if your DWH provider changes something and connectivity is for any reason lost, then we will not automatically manage this. We are however happy to help you with any maintenance job as a professional service.&#x20;
