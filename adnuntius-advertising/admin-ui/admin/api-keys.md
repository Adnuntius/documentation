# API Keys

**Scope** allows the access level of the API Key to be set. The values supported are:

* Stats Querying allows read-only access to stats data via the Adnuntius API or via the Tableau data connection.
* User Segment Uploads allows uploading of User Segment information for targeting into the Adnuntius platform.
* Download ad server logs allows users to download ad-server logs via SFTP.

**Description** is a user-friendly description of the API Key, for keeping track of which keys are used for which purpose. **Expiry** determines when the API Key will cease to allow access, to support restrictions on access should that be required.

Once you click Save, an API Key string is generated for you.
