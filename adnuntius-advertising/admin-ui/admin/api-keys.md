# API Keys

**Scopes** allows the access level of the API Key to be set. You can choose to:

* Query Stats.&#x20;
* Query Advertising.
* Update Advertising.
* Upload User Segments.
* Download Ad-Server Logs.
* Bidding Algorithm .

**Description** is a user-friendly description of the API Key, for keeping track of which keys are used for which purpose. **Expiry** determines when the API Key will cease to allow access, to support restrictions on access should that be required.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that creating API keys requires that you have set up two-factor authentication for logging in. You can set that up under your user profile at [https://admin.adnuntius.com/admin/user-profile](https://admin.adnuntius.com/admin/user-profile).
{% endhint %}

Once you click Save, an API Key string is generated for you.
