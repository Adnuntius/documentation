* Query Stats.&#x20;
* Query Advertising.
* Update Advertising.
* Upload User Segments.
* Download Ad-Server Logs.
* Bidding Algorithm .

**Description** is a user-friendly description of the API Key, for keeping track of which keys are used for which purpose. **Expiry** determines when the API Key will cease to allow access, to support restrictions on access should that be required.

Once you click Save, an API Key string is generated for you.
