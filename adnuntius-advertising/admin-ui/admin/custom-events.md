# Custom Events

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/iYCniJ9xfEI" caption="How to create and use custom events." %}

**Name and description**: Give the event a name and description \(optional\) of your choice.

**Value type** determines what is counted, and you can choose between number \(for example the number of events or conversions\), time in milliseconds or seconds \(for example, the seconds a user holds the cursor over an ad\), or money \(for example the value of a purchase online\).

**ID and code example**: Once you've created your event, you can paste the code with the ID into a [Layout](./#layouts) to start counting events.

![Once you have created a custom event you will also find it as a conversion event when adding a CPA bid to the line item.](../../../.gitbook/assets/202003-cpa-code.png)
