# Smoothing Ad Delivery

Adnuntius provides two different options for smooth ad delivery:

- *Even Pacing*: where the system attempts to deliver at a constant rate throughout the campaign
- *Front Loaded Pacing*: where the system delivers more quickly at the beginning of the campaign

The impact of chosing *Front Loading* is shown in the charts below.

Front Loading will cause your campaign to deliver up to 30% *faster* at the beginning.
Towards the end of the campaign the delivery will be relatively *slower* compared to an evenly paced delivery.

Both *Even* and *Front Loaded* pacing strategies aim to deliver ads all the way up to the end of your campaign.
