# Smoothing Ad Delivery

Adnuntius provided two different options for smooth ad delivery:

- Even Pacing: where the system attempts to deliver at a constant rate throughout the campaign
- Ahead Pacing: where the system delivers more quickly at the beginning of the campaign

The impact of chosing *Ahead Pacing* is shown in the charts below.

Ahead pacing will cause your campaign to deliver up to 30% *faster* at the beginning.
Towards the end of the campaign the delivery will be relatively *slower* compared to an evenly paced delivery.

Both *Even* and *Ahead* pacing strategies aim to deliver ads all the way up to the end of your campaign.
