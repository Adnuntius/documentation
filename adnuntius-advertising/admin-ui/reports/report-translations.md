# Report Translations

When you create reports based on [templates ](reports-templates-and-schedules.md#report-templates)you can determine what language they should have. To create a new language, [go to Report Translations under the Reports section](https://admin.adnuntius.com/report-translations), then click "new" in the upper right corner.&#x20;

Give your report translation a **name** and **description** of your choice. Next, set the **locale** to control such things as number and date formats.

The **default language** lets you choose English or German as the basis for the translations.&#x20;

Next, click "edit default translation" for any fields you would like to translate, and then add your translation. Finally, click save.
