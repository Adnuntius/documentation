How to run an advertising query.
{% endembed %}

You can apply multiple filters to get the data you want. For example: if you have added labels to advertisers, orders or line items, then you can filter by these labels to single out certain items in your reports.

**Metrics**: Here are the metrics returned by a query, and what they mean.

* Impression: An ad has been delivered by the Adnuntius adserver.
* Rendered Impression: An ad has been rendered onto a page.
* Visibles: An ad has shown one or more pixels in the viewport.
* Visibility: The share of impressions that were visible.
* Viewables: Ad ad has 50% or more of its pixels shown in the viewport for 1 second or longer.
* Viewability: The share of impressions that were viewable.
* Uniques: Unique users (browsers).
* Clicks: Clicks on an ad.
* CTR: Clickrate, meaning the share of impressions that produce a click.
* eCPM: (effective) cost per thousand ad impressions, calculated as \[Cost] / \[Impressions] x 1000.
* Cost: The revenue generated over the period.
* Average Auction Rank: The average rank of the ad impression. If more than one ad is shown inside an ad unit, this number is the ranking of this ad.
