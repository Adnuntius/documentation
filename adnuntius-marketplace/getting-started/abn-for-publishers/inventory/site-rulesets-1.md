# Blocklists

To create a new blocklist, go to [https://admin.adnuntius.com/blocklists/blocklist/](https://admin.adnuntius.com/blocklists/blocklist/) and click "new" in the upper right corner. Give your blocklist a name and optional description of your choice.

The **Team** determines who will have access to your ruleset.&#x20;

**Restrictions** lets you specify what you want to block or allow.

* If you set your restrictions to "block" then you will block all your entries but allow anything else.&#x20;
* If you set your restrictions to "allow" then you will allow only the entries you have entered.&#x20;
* If you use the Blocked Advertiser Domains and enter e.g. "example.com", then creatives that on click lead to that domain will be blocked from serving.
