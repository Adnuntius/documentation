# Rulesets (in progress)

To create a new ruleset, go to [https://admin.adnuntius.com/site-rulesets](https://admin.adnuntius.com/site-rulesets) and click "new" in the upper right corner. Give your ruleset a name and optional description of your choice.

The **Team** determines who will have access to your ruleset.

The **floor price** lets you set a minimum price for all your ad units in one place. If you for example set a floor of 3 EUR on your site ruleset, and then a floor of 5 EUR on a specific ad unit, then that ad unit's floor will be 5 EUR.&#x20;

**Advertiser-Specific Floor prices** lets you set a minimum price (CPM) per advertiser.&#x20;
