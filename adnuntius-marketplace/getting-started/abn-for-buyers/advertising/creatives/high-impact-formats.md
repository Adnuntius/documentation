# High Impact Formats

## What They Are and What’s Available

High impact formats are generally larger ads that take up more space and allow for better attention, and that have certain interactive qualities like for instance a parallax effect. Here is an example illustration of each of the formats available:

<table><thead><tr><th width="120">Format</th><th>Link to Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Midscroll</td><td><a href="https://assets.adnuntius.com/CtJHvMeWzRrOtzqs9sU3noqrYwAwyHRtaUzUDk2js-0.mp4">https://assets.adnuntius.com/CtJHvMeWzRrOtzqs9sU3noqrYwAwyHRtaUzUDk2js-0.mp4</a></td></tr><tr><td>Topscroll</td><td>Coming soon.</td></tr><tr><td>2x screen</td><td>Coming soon.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Here is a list of which publishers offer the different formats:

| Country | Publisher                             |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Norway  | TV2, Aller.                           |
| Denmark | Berlingske, Børsen, JP/Pol, TV2, JFM. |
| Sweden  | Stampen.                              |

## Creating a Campaign

To create a high impact campaign, you can create and manage Advertisers and Orders as you do with any campaign. When you create a Line Item, click “Update product” as shown in the screenshot below.

This opens up a modal window showing the products to which you have access. From here you can choose for instance “High Impact - Denmark - Topscroll”, or “High Impact - Norway - Midscroll”.&#x20;

* The product determines where (in which country) your ad will run.&#x20;
* The product also determines what format you will use, for instance midscroll or topscroll. If you want to run multiple formats you can create multiple line items, each with a different product.

Once this is done you can continue creating the line item as you do with other campaigns.

## Creative Specifications

From the line item you can click to create creatives. When adding a new creative, one of the first things you do is to select a layout. If you for instance chose “High Impact - Denmark - Topscroll” as the product on the line item, you can choose to upload images, videos, html or third party creatives. Here are the specifications.

| Layout Name         | File Type | Max File Size | Width and Height |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| High impact - Image |           |               |                  |
| High impact -       |           |               |                  |
|                     |           |               |                  |
