# Identification and Privacy

Adnuntius supports multiple methods of identifying users, both with and without 3rd party cookies. Here you will find an overview that explains how.

{% content-ref url="user-identification.md" %}
[user-identification.md](user-identification.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

This page describes how Adnuntius uses the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework version 2 (TCF2) to check for permission to use personal data:

{% content-ref url="consent-processing-tcf2.md" %}
[consent-processing-tcf2.md](consent-processing-tcf2.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Here you will see details about how we collect, store and use user data:

{% content-ref url="../privacy-details/" %}
[privacy-details](../privacy-details/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Here you will quickly learn how you as a consumer can check if Adnuntius is tracking you:
