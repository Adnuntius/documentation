# Google Ad Manager Integration

Adnuntius Advertising allows you to request advertising inventory from your Google Ad Manager (GAM) account, and uses Machine Learning to choose the best floor price to maximise revenue.

This guide describes the required steps to enable this functionality in Adnuntius.

{% hint style="info" %}
You must have your own GAM account to use this integration.
{% endhint %}

## Step 1 : Create a Google External Demand Source in Adnuntius

An External Demand Source is required to tell Adnuntius how to connect with your GAM account.


The External Demand Source requires the following information:

- The GAM Network Code
- The Currency used in GAM
- The Bid Levels, which controls how bids get converted to key-value targets for GAM. In the example screenshot we have specified NOK 1, NOK 2 and NOK 3
