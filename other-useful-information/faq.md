# FAQ

## Can ads be loaded synchronously or asynchronously?

Either is possible. Nevertheless, you should always try to load your ads asynchronously, which is the default method for loading ads and has many advantages. 

If, however, you have ads that must be loaded synchronously, you can do so with specific requests to the ad server that enable synchronous ad loading.

## What is the difference between a standard and basic ad tag?

The standard ad tag uses some advanced JavaScript to load and distribute ads throughout the page, but which can have mixed results on versions of Internet Explorer older than version 9.

The basic ad tag loads an ad directly into an IFrame, is simpler all round and is supported by even the versions of Internet Explorer older than version 9.
