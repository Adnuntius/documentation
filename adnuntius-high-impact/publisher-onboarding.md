# Publisher onboarding

Adnuntius high impact is a script that will allow you to serve high impact formats without having to do much work in your ad server. Currently it's only built to allow you yo book campaigns in Adnuntius Ad Server and serve high impact ads on a publisher page.

There are two ways to have high impact on your page with Adnuntius. One being having a Prebid.js setup and a template setup in Google Ad Manager that will make the ad larger on page. The other will be to use our script for an easy integration.

### The script

If you add this script to you page, it's easy to get started. Preferably put the script as high up on the page as possible.&#x20;

```html
<script src="https://assets.adnuntius.com/aim.js" async></script>
```

### Testing

You can test your work by requesting a 1x1 from prebid using this ad unit ID: <mark style="color:red;">`37382a`</mark> If it works, you should see an ad that looks like this:
