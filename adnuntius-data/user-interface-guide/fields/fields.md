# Fields

Fields is an overview that allows you to see the various fields that make up a user profile in Adnuntius Data.

Letâ€™s say that you are sending data to Adnuntius Data using the Javascript API. The example visualized [here](../../api-documentation/) shows you how you can send data to the fields firstName, dateOfBirth and lastTransactionAmount. These are just three examples of fields to which you can send data.

![When you send data to Adnuntius Data you can attach each data point to one of these fields.](../../../.gitbook/assets/202003-ad-fields-fields-_1_.gif)

We provide many values, but in general they can be categorized by different values within basic \(demographic\) information, contact information, education, interests and hobbies, social media, products, transactions, and extra data fields \(which allows you to define custom values\).
