# Fields

Fields is an overview that allows you to see the various fields that make up a user profile in Adnuntius Data.

Letâ€™s say that you are sending data to Adnuntius Data using the Javascript API. The example visualized [here](../../sending-data/) shows you how you can send data to the fields firstName, dateOfBirth and lastTransactionAmount. These are just three examples of fields to which you can send data.
