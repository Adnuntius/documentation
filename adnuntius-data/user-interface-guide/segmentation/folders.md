  Folders ensure that multiple parties can send data to one network without
  unintentionally sharing them with others. Here is how you create folders.

# Folders

**Name and description**. Give the trigger a name and description \(optional\) of your choice.

**Custom data** is used when exporting data to external systems. It allows you to, for example, attach some account identifier to the folder that can then be used by the data exporter.

**Team membership.** Teams are shared across Adnuntius Data and Adnuntius Advertising, and you will find full documentation on [how to create users, teams and roles](../../../adnuntius-advertising/admin-ui/admin/users-teams-and-roles.md) under the Adnuntius Advertising section. A team will determine which system users will have access to your folder. Once a user has access to a folder they can see the folder ID and then start sending data to that folder.
