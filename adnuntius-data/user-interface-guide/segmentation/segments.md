  Segments are defined by a group of users, grouped together based on common
  actions (triggers). Here is how you create segments.

# Segments

To create a segment, go to [https://admin.adnuntius.com/segments](https://admin.adnuntius.com/segments) and click "new" in the upper right corner.

**Name and description**. Give the trigger a name and description \(optional\) of your choice. Members shows you how many users are currently part of this segment. 

**Duration** allows you to determine whether a segment remains associated to a user profile for the default length of time \(which depends on the subscription you choose when you enter a license agreement with Adnuntius\), or for a length of time specified by you \(using any number of minutes, hours and days\). 

**Segment sharing** allows you to determine whether a segment should be visible to anyone accessing Adnuntius, or to a specific folder. This is useful for a number of scenarios, but letâ€™s do an example: if you run a network gathering multiple advertisers and publishers into one network, then you can allow user 1 access a folder containing segments derived from data collected from property 1, while user 2 can access a folder containing segments derived from data collected from property 2. Then as a super admin, you can access all segments across the entire network. 

Once a segment is created you be able to access graphs showing you, over any defined time period, how many users are added and how many are removed.
