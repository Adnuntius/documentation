# Segmentation

## Concept Summary

| Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Triggers](triggers.md) | A set of user actions that determine when a user should be added or removed from a segment. |
| [Segments](segments.md) | A group of users, grouped together based on common actions \(triggers\). |
| [Folders](folders.md) | Triggers and segments can be added to folders, which in turns are accessible to teams; all so that you can control which users have access to which triggers. |
